============

I'll store the code I write at Hacker School (hackerschool.com) during summer 2013 in this repo.

log of awesome HS things:

6/4/2013: I finished a chunk of python code today! It was the first of the Matasano Crypto Challenges (http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/), and it was pretty fun.  However, per the rules of these challenges, I can't post my code here.  On to challenge #2!
